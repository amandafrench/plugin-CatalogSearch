# Catalog Search Plugin for Omeka

A plugin for [Omeka][] that uses the subject field in an Omeka item to
generate links to searches in catalogs such as Archive Grid, JSTOR,
Google Books, Google Scholar, the Library of Congress, and WorldCat.
This plugin was created for the [American Converts Database][] but it is
useful more generally. This plugin works best if you use Omeka's
[Library of Congress Suggest plugin][] to add LoC authorities and
vocabularies to your items.

## Future Plans

Future versions of this plugin will let users

-   configure which links they wish to include;
-   create their own custom searches, as in Google Chrome.
